This program runs a game card game called Euchre. You start off by choosing how many cards you want to play with. Then the game begins. The human player always goes first and the next player who goes is the one who one the previous trick. The rules of Euchre are explained at the beginning of the game so people unfamliar with the game won't be entirely lost. After you have chosen the game type the first player chooses which card will be trump, this opportunity rotates around to each AI before returning to the player. The human player is paired up with player2 and player1 and player3 are paired up with each other as well. Each team has a number of points. Whoever gets to 10 points first wins. Points are acquired by winning hands. 

We started out by making classes for all the objects involved, cards, decks, etc. Then after that we included functions on how to make the deck smaller by taking cards away and shuffling it. We then included classes for the player and the AIs as well as a turn class which would contain the bulk of the game. This turn class delt the cards and helped decie what trump would be that hand. Inside turn we had the trick class which would run the game depending on what turn it was or who won the last trick. After all of that was completed we created the play_game function which would allow the entire game to be played. This is where our score keeping variables were stored, where the player and deck classes were created and where the entire game would be played. Most of our data is put here for use if needed. We felt it was necessary to contruct the game this way because it allowed us as coders to understand it better. Some functions like player_trick and AI_trick might have worked better as methods but in terms of organization and variable tracking it was much easier and less headache inducing to make them separate functions. 

In it's current state most to all of the program works. The AI respond correctly and while we would have liked to have a more complex AI for starting the trick, we feel that our time was better spent ironing out all the bugs for when the AI was responding to the player or to itself. Another point we would have liked to fully implemented was to restrict what cards the player can and cannot play. As it is the input for the player is fairly delicate and doesn't work in some circumstances. We would have liked it to be that if you had a card of the leading suit in your hand and played a card of either trump or a non-leading suit that a message appeared saying that you could not do that. This didn't come to fruition though. However, we think everything else about the game works just fine and are proud of what we've done.

Instructions for the game can be found at the beginning of the game.
