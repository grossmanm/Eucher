This is a modified verison of the card game Euchre. 
This game operates much like Hearts in that the goal is for a pair to win at least
three of five tricks in a hand. 
In this version trump is declared by each player in a rotating fashion after each hand, starting with the player.
There are no 'bowers' in this version, in their place we use a Red and a White Joker.
The Red Joker is the highest card in the trump suit and the white, the second highest.

    Play:

    Play begins with you first choosing trump and then selecting a card to play. 
    After everyone has played a card, the winner of the trick is determined and
    they select a card to lead the next hand. 
    Each player is partnered across the table to form a pair. 

    Winning a Trick: 

    In Euchre in order to win a trick you must follow the suit of the card that was
    first lead or play a trump card. 
    You are only able to play a trump card or discard a card when you cannot follow
    suit. The player with the highest value card played of the lead suit or highest
    value trump wins the trick. 

    Scoring:

    For every trick you win in a hand, that player earns a point. If a pair wins
    three tricks in a hand they recieve an extra 2 points, and if they sweep the hand
    (win all 5 tricks), an extra 3 points are awarded to that pair's total score. 
    If a pair does not win at least three tricks in a hand they are docked a point.
    If a pair is swept they loose an additional point. 

    Winning:
    A pair wins they game when they collectively earn 10 points.
